# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized Chrome Extension Installation
- [Scenario Creation](link-to-scenario-creation-if-applicable.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Google Chrome Browser

## Scenario

Management has raised concerns regarding the potential installation of unauthorized Chrome extensions by employees, which could pose security risks or violate company policies. The goal of this threat hunt is to identify any instances of Chrome extension downloads on employee devices and analyze the findings to determine the nature and potential impact of these extensions. If any unauthorized or suspicious extensions are identified, further investigation and remediation steps will be necessary.

### High-Level Chrome Extension Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `.crx` file downloads, specifically those initiated by `chrome.exe`.
- **Analyze the download paths** to understand the source of the extensions (e.g., Web Store, external websites).
- **Correlate download times** with Chrome browser installation and usage events.
- **Further investigation (manual or automated)** may be required to identify the names and purposes of the downloaded extensions.

Summary

The user "lucky-man" downloaded the Chrome browser and subsequently downloaded four distinct Chrome extension files. Two extensions were downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, while others came from temporary or automated locations. These downloads occurred shortly after the browser installation.

üîç Recommendations

Investigate Installed Extensions: On the "lucky-man" VM, navigate to chrome://extensions/ to identify the installed extensions.

Assess Risk: Evaluate the legitimacy and permissions of each extension.

User Education: If unauthorized or risky extensions are present, educate the user about approved extension usage.

Extension Management: Implement Chrome management policies to control allowed extensions.

Ongoing Monitoring: Continue surveillance for unusual browser-related behavior.

‚úÖ This investigation indicates a need for further review into the legitimacy and intent of downloaded Chrome extensions to protect the organization's endpoint security.
